## Find 360 Photos

Flickr has thousands of [equirectangular photos](https://www.flickr.com/search/?group_id=44671723%40N00&view_all=1&text=) available under the creative commons license. Download one, and upload it to the assets folder. Then copy URL, and the src and id in the assets component.

## Create Your Own

You can also create your own photospheres with the Google Street View app for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.street&hl=en) or [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/photo-sphere-camera/id904418768?mt=8).
